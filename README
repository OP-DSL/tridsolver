TRIDIAGONAL SOLVERS
-------------------
The project includes batch scalar and block tridiagonal solver libraries for GPU, CPU and Intel MIC  -- in the /scalar and /block directories -- as well as test applications in the /apps directory.

As the use cases of scalar and block tridiagonal solvers differ significantly in most applications the implementation of the two libraries is separated in two subprojects in /scalar and /block directories. These subprojects can be built from corresponding directories using CMake. Note: the scalar solver only supports Intel compiler as it relies on AVX and IMCI intrinsics.


TEST APPLICATIONS
-----------------
Test applications in /apps include: 1) the solution of the heat diffusion PDE using the ADI (Atlernating Direction Implicit) method and 2) the solution of a general block tridiagonal system of equations. 


BUILDING
--------
Details on building the subprojects (solvers and test applications) can be found in the README file of the appropriate subdirectories.
